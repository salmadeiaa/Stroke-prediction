# Stroke-prediction
machine learning project to predict Strokes

This project employs machine learning to analyze a dataset on stroke risk factors, aiming to build a predictive model for stroke occurrence. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes features like age, hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, BMI, and lifestyle factors. Key steps include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Seaborn visualizations, feature scaling, model building with logistic regression, random forest, and SVM classifiers, model evaluation, and deployment via a Streamlit web application. The project focuses on preprocessing, analysis, model selection, and deployment to create a predictive tool for stroke risk assessment.
